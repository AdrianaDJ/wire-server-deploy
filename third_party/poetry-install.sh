# scripts in any other way than `poetry shell` or `poetry run`.

# Thus, we have to roll our own little piece of cursed code that will look at
# installed binaries within the poetry virtualenv and installs them to
# third_party/bin. (caveat: not from third_party/venv, but the venv that poetry
# itself creates and manages - third_party/venv exists to force poetry to run a
# given Python version, and allows us to install poetry without system
# administrator privileges).

# Run everything in a subshell that lives in third_party/ - poetry expects
# to run from the CWD where the project lives.

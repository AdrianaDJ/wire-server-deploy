## Wire server deployment

This repository contains code and documentation on how to deploy [wire-server](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server). To allow a maximum of flexibility with respect to where wire-server can be deployed (e.g. with cloud providers like AWS, on bare-metal servers, etc), we chose kubernetes as the target platform.

This means you first need to install a kubernetes cluster, and then deploy wire-server onto that kubernetes cluster.

### Prerequisites

You need:

* a **Kubernetes cluster** with enough resources. There are [many different options](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/). A tiny subset of those solutions we tried include:
    * if using AWS, you may want to look at:
        * [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (if you're okay having all your data in one of the EKS-supported US regions)
        * [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
    * if using regular physical or virtual servers:
        * [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray)
* a **Domain Name** under your control and the ability to set DNS entries
* the ability to generate **SSL certificates** for that domain name
    * you could use e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
* depending on your required functionality, you may or may not need an [**AWS account**](https://aws.amazon.com/). See details about limitations without an AWS account in the following sections.

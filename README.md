## Introduction

This repository contains code and documentation on how to deploy [wire-server](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-server). To allow a maximum of flexibility with respect to where wire-server can be deployed (e.g. with cloud providers like AWS, on bare-metal servers, etc), we chose kubernetes as the target platform.

This means you first need to install a kubernetes cluster, and then deploy wire-server onto that kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

You need:

* a **Kubernetes cluster** with enough resources. There are [many different options](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/pick-right-solution/). A tiny subset of those solutions we tried include:
    * if using AWS, you may want to look at:
        * [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (if you're okay having all your data in one of the EKS-supported US regions)
        * [kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops)
    * if using regular physical or virtual servers:
        * [kubespray](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/kubespray)
* a **Domain Name** under your control and the ability to set DNS entries
* the ability to generate **SSL certificates** for that domain name
    * you could use e.g. [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
* an email server (allowing SMTP) to send out registration emails
* depending on your required functionality, you may or may not need an [**AWS account**](https://aws.amazon.com/). See details about limitations without an AWS account in the following sections.

Supported features

### Demo installation

* AWS account not required
* limited functionality
* Requires only a kubernetes cluster

The demo setup is the easiest way to install a functional wire-server with limitations (such as no persistent storage, no high-availability, missing features). For the purposes of this demo, we assume you **do not have an AWS account**. Try this demo first before trying to configure a more complicated setup involving persistence and higher availability.

*For all the following `helm upgrade` commands, it can be useful to run a second terminal with `kubectl --namespace demo get pods -w` to see what's happening.*

#### Install non-persistent, non-highly-available databases

*Please note that this setup is for demonstration purposes; expect it to be unstable: you may experience total service unavailability and/or total data loss after a few hours/days due to the way e.g. kubernetes and cassandra interact. For more information on this see the production installation section.*

The following will install (or upgrade) 3 single-pod databases and 3 ClusterIP services to reach them:

- **databases-ephemeral**
    - cassandra-ephemeral
    - elasticsearch-ephemeral
    - redis-ephemeral

```shell
./bin/update.sh databases-ephemeral # a recursive wrapper around 'helm dep update'
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-databases-ephemeral charts/databases-ephemeral --wait
```

To delete: `helm delete --purge demo-databases-ephemeral`

#### Install AWS service mocks

The code in wire-server still depends on some AWS services for some of its functionality. To ensure wire-server services can correctly start up, install the following "fake" (limited-functionality, non-HA) aws services:

- **fake-aws**
    - fake-aws-sqs
    - fake-aws-sns
    - fake-aws-s3
    - fake-aws-dynamodb

```shell
./bin/update.sh fake-aws
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-fake-aws charts/fake-aws --wait
```

To delete: `helm delete --purge demo-fake-aws`

#### Install wire-server

- **wire-server**
    - cassandra-migrations
    - elasticsearch-index
    - galley
    - gundeck
    - brig
    - cannon
    - nginz
    - proxy (optional, disabled by default)
    - spar (optional, disabled by default)

Start by copying the necessary configuration files:

```
cp values/demo-values.example.yaml values/demo-values.yaml
cp values/demo-secrets.example.yaml values/demo-secrets.yaml
```

In `values/demo-values.yaml` (referred to as `values` file below) and `values/demo-secrets.yaml` (referred to as `secrets` file), the following has to be adapted:

* smtp credentials (to allow for email sending; prerequisite for registering users and running the smoketest)
    * *if using a gmail account, ensure to enable ['less secure apps'](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)*
    * Add user, smtp server, connection type in values/`brig.config.smtp`
    * Add password in secrets/`brig.secrets.smtpPassword`
* turn server shared key (needed for audio/video calling)
    * Generate with e.g. `openssl rand -base64 64 | env LC_CTYPE=C tr -dc a-zA-Z0-9 | head -c 42` or similar
    * Add value to secrets/`brig.secrets.turn.secret`
    * (this will eventually need to be shared with a turn server, not part of this demo yet)
* zauth private/public keys (For authentication; `access tokens` and `user tokens` (cookies) are signed and validated with these)
    * Generate from within [wire-server](github.com/wireapp/wire-server) with `./dist/zauth -m gen-keypair -i 1` if you have everything compiled; or alternatively with docker using `docker run --rm quay.io/wire/alpine-intermediate /dist/zauth -m gen-keypair -i 1`
    * add both to secrets/`brig.zauth` and the public one to secrets/`nginz.secrets.zauth`
* domain names and urls
    * in `values`, replace `example.com` and other domains and subdomains with domains of your choosing. Look for the `# change this` comments.

Update the chart dependencies:

```sh
./bin/update.sh wire-server
```

Try linting your chart, are any configuration values missing?

```sh
helm lint -f values/demo-values.yaml -f values/demo-secrets.yaml charts/wire-server
```

If you're confident in your configuration, try installing it:

```sh
helm upgrade --install --namespace demo demo-wire-server charts/wire-server \
    -f values/demo-values.yaml \
    -f values/demo-secrets.yaml \
    --wait
```

### Demo-AWS

* AWS account required
* Similar limited functionality to Demo except:
    * Allows using ELBs for incoming traffic
    * Potentially better availability of some parts

Differences to the [Demo installation](#demo-installation) are:

* instead of using fake-aws charts, you need to set up the respective services in your account, create queues,tables etc. Have a look at the fake-aws-* charts; you'll need to replicate a similar setup.
    * Once real AWS resources are created, adapt the configuration in the values and secrets files to use real endpoints and real AWS keys.
* instead of using a mail server and connect with SMTP, you may use SES. See configuration of brig and the `useSES` toggle.
* You can use ELBs in front of nginz for higher availability.
* SQS/dynamo have better availability gurantees.

### Production on-premise installation

For the time being, get in touch. See [this page](https://wire.com/pricing/).
